    "Since the start of global pandemic in March 2020 a lot of things have changed. One of many changes is that people relocating to other cities and looking to buy/rent apartments or houses in new cities. Lets look at one of the largest cities in USA - New York. New York is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2021 population of 8,230,290 distributed over about 302.6 square miles, New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. However, during pandemic, many media outlets reported people abandoning New York City for suburbs or even other states, thus recording sharp reduction in property values. While some people getting away from the city, other groups of people may find great oportunity to finally be able to afford to move to NYC and in recent month it was reported that finally prices for rent and purchase of properties started to go higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a someone who has never even visited NYC before but always dreamed of living there, even temporarily, it can be ovelwelming task to figure out which neighborhood would suit the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "NYC has five of Boroughs : Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island. I will try to analyze neighborhood with a wide range of amenities and facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Manhhatan has the most to offer for sightseeings, Broadway shows, museums and parks, diverse restaurant cuisines,\n",
    "\n",
    "in addtiong to the convenient public transportation, in this report I will look at Manhattan data only.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report will provide better undestanding of Manhattan neighborhoods, thus helping to choose best area.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to cluster Manhattan neighborhoods in order to recommend neighborhood based on amenities, restaurant, parks and grocery stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, this project is a good practical case toward the development of Data Science skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the above questions, data on New York City neighborhoods, boroughs to include boundaries, latitude, longitude, restaurants, etc. are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "New York City data containing the neighborhoods and boroughs, latitudes, and longitudes will be obtained from the data source: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "I also found and downloaded Manhatten Rolled Sales Data from March 2020 to February 2021 at https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/pdf/rolling_sales/rollingsales_manhattan.xls.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore and target recommended locations across different neighborhoods according to the presence of amenities and essential facilities, we will access data through FourSquare API interface \n",
    "\n",
    "and arrange them as a dataframe for visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "By merging data on Manhattan properties and data on amenities and essential facilities surrounding such properties from FourSquare API interface, \n",
    "\n",
    "we will be able to recommend potential relocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries Which are Used to Develop the Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of Algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project I choose K-Means Clustering. https://towardsdatascience.com/clustering-algorithms-for-customer-segmentation-af637c6830ac \n",
    "    \n",
    "A backgrounder on K-Means clustering : “K-means clustering is an iterative clustering algorithm where the number of clusters K is predetermined and the algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to one of the K clusters based on the feature similarity.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Alalysis Process\n",
    "    \n",
    "I found Manhattan sales from March 2020 - February 2021 and had to clean the data first. Initially I had over 11000 sales in Borough of Manhattan, but after cleaning the data, I got 6050 properties sold in 39 neighborhoods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I have found that out of all of them, the majority of sales 627 happened to be in Upper West Side, 448 in Upper East Side (from 59th street to 79th street) and 426 on Upper East Side (from 79th to 96th street).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 Plot : Number of Sales in Manhattan per Neighborhood from March 2020 to February 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "From this bar we can observe the most sales from March 2020 - February 2021 occured in Manhattan neighborhood of Upper West side and Upper East side\n",
    "\n",
    "So in my report I will look at those two neighborhoods - Upper West side and Upper East Side from 59th to 96th street and see what those areas have to offer to potential resident. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2 Download and explore dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "I Downloaded and explored newyork_data.json, Then I created a dataframe called neighborhoods.\n",
    "Next, sliced original dataframe neighborhoods and created a new dataframe of the Manhattan data, \n",
    "called manhattan_data as I only want to \n",
    "look at Manhattan neighborhoods. \n",
    "Then I got the latitude and longitude values of Manhattan using GeoPy library.\n",
    "Created a map of Manhattan with neighborhoods superimposed on top using Folium library.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.3 Foursquare API Neighborhoods Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to utilize the Foursquare location data, I need to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was not able to get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods using the Geocoder package, I use the given csv file instead that was given in another lab class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next step, I get nearby venues for all the neighborhoods in Manhattan using Foursquare API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Name the dataframe as manhattan_venues. It has 3314 venues and 325 unique categories\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze each neighborhood in Manhattan\n",
    "perform one hot encoding and create a dataframe called manhattan_onehot\n",
    "group rows by neighborhood and take the mean frequency of occurrence of each category. Create a dataframe called manhattan_grouped\n",
    "find out the most common venues in each neighborhood. Create a dataframe called neighborhoods_venues_sorted\n",
    "- Cluster neighborhoods using K-means\n",
    "find the best k\n",
    "create a new dataframe that includes the cluster and the top 10 venues for each neighborhood name it manhattan_merged\n",
    "visualize the resulting clusters using Folium library.\n",
    "Now, I can examine each cluster and determine the 10 most common venues for selected neighborhoods - Upper West Side and Upper East Side\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Examine Clusters \n",
    "\n",
    "After I examine each cluster and determined 10 most common values for selected neighborhoods.\n",
    "Upper West Side and Upper East Side are both in Cluster 3. Cluster 3 is the most artistic one of all of them. \n",
    "This cluster is good for people who value art, theater, parks, want to have a great social life, like to work out. \n",
    "Some of the most common venues are: restaurants, shops, art galleries, gyms, spas, theaters and parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Results and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of this project was to identify the good place in New York to relocate. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found out that the majority of sales in New York Manhattan Borough from March 2020 to February 2021 happened in Upper West Side and Upper East Side.\n",
    "\n",
    "From analyzing clusters I can see that both areas have great choices of restaurants, bakeris, coffee shops, museums, art galleries, playgrounds, yoga studios and gyms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Great advantage of those two areas is close proximity to Central Park, walking distance 10-15 minutes depending on exact location.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result for someone relocating to New York City, I would recommend to start looking at those two areas first. \n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like it can be great place for families or single people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further recommendation in choosing one neighborhood over the other would be considering the budget size and examining prices of desired housing size in both neighborhoods. \n"
